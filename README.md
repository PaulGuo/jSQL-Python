### jSQL for Python (tornado, etc.)

This project used jsql(javascript) syntax, and Query.py is a wrapper for tornado's database,
you can also plug it to some other framework easily, like flask, web.py, etc. Even you can
use it without framework, only with some database engine like MySQLdb and PyMySQL.
